    <h1>Who Are Astronauts?</h1>
    <p>
      Astronauts are trained professionals who travel into space to conduct scientific research, operate spacecraft, and explore the universe beyond Earth. They undergo rigorous physical and technical training to prepare for the challenges of space missions. Astronauts work in space stations like the International Space Station (ISS) and participate in missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

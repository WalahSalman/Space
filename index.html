      Space is that vast expanse containing millions of galaxies, stars, and planets, serving as a stage for many fascinating cosmic phenomena such as black holes and stellar explosions. It remains a domain full of mysteries that scientists strive to uncover through research and advanced technology. From exploring the universe to searching for possibilities of life beyond Earth, space remains one of the most intriguing fields for curiosity and scientific progress.

        <h2>Read about planet Earth</h2>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a unique atmosphere that allows liquid water to exist, making it habitable. Earth rotates once every 23.9 hours and orbits the Sun in 365.25 days, which is why we have leap years. It also has a strong magnetic field that protects it from harmful solar radiation.

        <h2>Read about the planet Saturn</h2>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is famous for its spectacular ring system, which is the most extensive in the solar system. It is a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and has a fast rotation, completing one spin in about 10.7 hours. Saturn takes 29.4 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. It also has 274 moons, more than any other planet.

        <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun, making it the most distant in the solar system. It is an ice giant with a deep blue color due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune has the strongest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). A year on Neptune lasts 165 Earth years, and it has six faint rings.

        <h2>Read about planet Mars</h2>
        <p>Mars, known as the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide in its soil. Scientists believe it had liquid water in the past, raising questions about possible ancient life. It also has the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, standing at 25.75 km high!.

        <h2>Read about planet Jupiter</h2>
        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, bigger than all the other planets combined. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and has a bright appearance, making it one of the most visible planets from Earth. Jupiter completes one orbit around the Sun every 12 Earth years, but it rotates very fast, finishing one full spin in just 10 hours.</p>

        <h2>Read about planet Uranus </h2>
        <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique because it rotates on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. This makes it appear as if it's rolling around the Sun rather than spinning like other planets. It is also known as an ice giant, with a cold atmosphere containing methane, which gives it a blue-green color. Uranus completes one orbit around the Sun every 84 Earth years.

        <h2>Read about planet Mercury</h2>
        <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system and the closest to the Sun. Despite its proximity, it is not the hottest planet—Venus holds that title due to its thick atmosphere. Mercury has no moons or rings, and a year on Mercury lasts only 88 Earth days. Because it lacks a significant atmosphere, its surface experiences extreme temperature swings, reaching 427°C during the day and dropping to -173°C at night.

        <h2>Read about planet Venus</h2>
        <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size and composition. However, it has a thick atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching 471°C. A day on Venus lasts longer than a year—it takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, while its orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days.
